# Satisfactory Cheat:
 A Cheat for Satisfactory on Steam

# Known Bugs/Issues:
- Use of the `FRAMEWORK_RENDER_D3D12` flag allows for DirectX 12 rendering but breaks the unloading of the cheat, which causes crashes when attempting to unload..

# Plans:
- [X] Teleport (Done, but still investigating for potential crashes or issues)
- [X] Speedhack
- [ ] Reach
- [ ] Box ESP
- [ ] Box ESP Flags (Ex. Alpha, Nuclear, Elite)
- [X] Name ESP

- [ ] Possibly Glow ESP (Using the hologram texture if possible)
