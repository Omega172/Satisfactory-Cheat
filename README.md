# Satisfactory Cheat:
 A Cheat for Satisfactory on Steam

# Known Bugs/Issues:
- Use of the `FRAMEWORK_RENDER_D3D12` flag allows for DirectX 12 rendering but breaks the unloading of the cheat, which causes crashes when attempting to unload..

# Plans:
- [X] Map Teleport (Done, but still investigating for potential crashes or issues)
- [X] Speedhack
- [X] Name ESP
- [X] Box ESP
- [X] Box ESP Flags (Ex. Alpha, Nuclear, Elite)

- [ ] Possibly Glow/Chams using the hologram texture (I don't think this is possible)
